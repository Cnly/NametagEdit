Quick Info
----------
I have decided that, for the next few versions, this file
will be mandatory in your plugins folder. This is because
huge amounts of the plugin have changed internally, and while
they may be clear to me and others, some may still face issues.

This is the largest, "plugin-breaking" change to this plugin
to date. I have rewritten huge portions of the plugin, as well as
discontinuing some of the previous author's implementation.

tl;dr Lots of changes, your old files are broken

Here's an example use of the configuration: https://gist.github.com/sgtcaze/e65675998bd8427e3c94

FAQ
---

1) My client crashes with the reason "Cannot remove from NTE #"
Answer: Because of how scoreboards were implemented in Minecraft, a player
cannot belong to two teams. Any two scoreboard plugins, whether through packets
or the bukkit scoreboard api - which are basically the same thing, that alter
team prefixes/suffixes, will have conflicts. There is currently no way around this.

2) My prefixes/suffixes are incorrect
Answer: This is likely to due to the structure of your permissions. Please
ensure the correct groups inherit the correct permissions.
